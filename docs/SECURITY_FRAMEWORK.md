# ??? AI Model Sentinel Enterprise - Security Framework 
 
## ?? Encryption Standards 
 
### Data Encryption 
- **AES-256** for data encryption 
- **PBKDF2** for key derivation 
- **SHA-256** for integrity checks 
- **Quantum-resistant** algorithms for future-proofing 
 
### Access Control System 
\`\`\`python 
USER_ROLES = { 
    "SUPER_ADMIN": "Full system access", 
    "DEVELOPER": "Model development and testing", 
    "AUDITOR": "Security and compliance monitoring", 
    "ANALYST": "Data analysis and reporting" 
} 
\`\`\` 
 
## ?? Threat Detection 
 
### Real-time Monitoring 
- **Anomaly detection** using behavioral analysis 
- **Pattern recognition** for known attack vectors 
- **Risk scoring** (0-100) for threat assessment 
- **Automatic alerts** for suspicious activities 
 
### Security Policies 
 
#### 1. Password Policy 
- Minimum 12 characters 
- Mixed case, numbers, and symbols 
- 90-day expiration for service accounts 
- 5 failed attempts lockout 
 
#### 2. Data Protection 
- Encryption at rest for all sensitive data 
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.3 
- Regular key rotation every 90 days 
- Secure deletion of temporary files 
 
- Comprehensive activity logging 
- 365-day log retention 
- Regular security assessments 
- Compliance with enterprise security standards 
 
## ?? Backup Security 
 
### Backup Encryption 
- All backups encrypted with AES-256 
- SHA-256 checksum verification 
- Secure key management 
- 30-day automatic retention
